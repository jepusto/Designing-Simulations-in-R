## Form of address

We generally use "we" both as in the authors, and the collective "we" to bring in our friends the readers.
If working on exercises, where we the authors are not doing things, but the reader is, we use "you".
In some cases we can use the more abstract "one" if we are trying to not call out the specific reader doing the reading; it is a bit less accusatory.

## Code style

We (mostly) use the [tidyverse style](https://style.tidyverse.org/) guide for R code.
For spaces around parenthesis we have this:
```
run_sim <- function( N, J ) {
  # code here
  math <- ( 2*N + J ) / 2
}
```
not this:
```
run_sim <- function(N, J) {
  # code here
  math <- (2*N+J)/2
}
```
Removing spaces to clump things into integral conceptual units is ok, but those units should be given space to live apart from other units.

LWM: James, you ok with this?  I always like spaces `( stuff )` since it makes `stuff` stand out for me visually.

# Function skeletons

Should they work "out of the box"?  E.g.,

```
f <- function( ) {
  #stuff
  return( result )
}
```
would not work.  Is ok?
