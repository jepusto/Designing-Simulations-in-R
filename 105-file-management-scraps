### Dynamically making directories

If you are generating a lot of files, then you should put them somewhere.
But where?
It can be nice to dynamically generate a directory for your files on fly.
One way to do this is to write a function that will make any needed directory, if it doesn't exist, and then put your file in that spot.
For example, you might have your own version of `write_csv` as:

```{r my_write_csv_function}
my_write_csv <- function( data, path, file ) {
  
  if ( !dir.exists( here::here( path ) ) ) {
    dir.create( here::here( path ), recursive=TRUE ) 
  }
  write_csv( data, paste0( path, file ) )
}
```

This will look for a path (starting from your R Project, by taking advantage of the `here` package), and put your data file in that spot.
If the spot doesn't exist, it will make it for you.
