 abstract={A huge amount of effort is spent cleaning data to get it ready for analysis, but there has been little research on how to make data cleaning as easy and effective as possible. This paper tackles a small, but important, component of data cleaning: data tidying. Tidy datasets are easy to manipulate, model and visualize, and have a specific structure: each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational unit is a table. This framework makes it easy to tidy messy datasets because only a small set of tools are needed to deal with a wide range of un-tidy datasets. This structure also makes it easier to develop tidy tools for data analysis, tools that both input and output tidy datasets. The advantages of a consistent data structure and matching tools are demonstrated with a case study free from mundane data manipulation chores.},

	abstract = {{The present article considers a fundamental question in evaluation research: ``By how much do program effects vary across sites?'' The article first presents a theoretical model of cross-site impact variation and a related estimation model with a random treatment coefficient and fixed site-specific intercepts. This approach eliminates several biases that can arise from unbalanced sample designs for multisite randomized trials. The article then describes how the approach operates, explores its assumptions, and applies the approach to data from three large welfare-to-work trials. The article also illustrates how to report cross-site impact findings and presents diagnostics for assessing these findings. To keep the article manageable, it focuses on experimental estimates of effects of program assignment (effects of intent to treat), although the ideas presented can be extended to analyses of multisite quasi-experiments and experimental estimates of effects of program participation (complier average causal effects).}},

  abstract = {Over two decades ago, Brown and Forsythe (B-F) (1974) proposed an innovative solution to the problem of comparing independent normal means under heteroscedasticity. Since then, their testing procedure has gained in popularity and authors have published various articles in which the B-F test has formed the basis of their research. The purpose of this paper is to point out, and correct, a flaw in the B-F testing procedure. Specifically, it is shown that the approximation proposed by B-F for the null distribution of their test statistic is inadequate. An improved approximation is provided and the small sample null properties of the modified B-F test are studied via simulation. The empirical findings support the theoretical result that the modified B-F test does a better job of preserving the test size compared to the original B-F test.},

@article{Kern_calibrated,
	abstract = {{Randomized experiments are considered the gold standard for causal inference because they can provide unbiased estimates of treatment effects for the experimental participants. However, researchers and policymakers are often interested in using a specific experiment to inform decisions about other target populations. In education research, increasing attention is being paid to the potential lack of generalizability of randomized experiments because the experimental participants may be unrepresentative of the target population of interest. This article examines whether generalization may be assisted by statistical methods that adjust for observed differences between the experimental participants and members of a target population. The methods examined include approaches that reweight the experimental data so that participants more closely resemble the target population and methods that utilize models of the outcome. Two simulation studies and one empirical analysis investigate and compare the methods' performance. One simulation uses purely simulated data while the other utilizes data from an evaluation of a school-based dropout prevention program. Our simulations suggest that machine learning methods outperform regression-based methods when the required structural (ignorability) assumptions are satisfied. When these assumptions are violated, all of the methods examined perform poorly. Our empirical analysis uses data from a multisite experiment to assess how well results from a given site predict impacts in other sites. Using a variety of extrapolation methods, predicted effects for each site are compared to actual benchmarks. Flexible modeling approaches perform best, although linear regression is not far behind. Taken together, these results suggest that flexible modeling techniques can aid generalization while underscoring the fact that even state-of-the-art statistical techniques still rely on strong assumptions.}},

    abstract = { Background:An important question in the design of experiments is how to ensure that the findings from the experiment are generalizable to a larger population. This concern with generalizability is particularly important when treatment effects are heterogeneous and when selecting units into the experiment using random sampling is not possibleâ€”two conditions commonly met in large-scale educational experiments.Method:This article introduces a model-based balanced-sampling framework for improving generalizations, with a focus on developing methods that are robust to model misspecification. Additionally, the article provides a new method for sample selection within this framework: First units in an inference population are divided into relatively homogenous strata using cluster analysis, and then the sample is selected using distance rankings.Result:In order to demonstrate and evaluate the method, a reanalysis of a completed experiment is conducted. This example compares samples selected using the new method with the actual sample used in the experiment. Results indicate that even under high nonresponse, balance is better on most covariates and that fewer coverage errors result.Conclusion:The article concludes with a discussion of additional benefits and limitations of the method. }

  abstract = {In the presence of heteroscedasticity, ordinary least squares (OLS) estimates are unbiased, but the usual tests of significance are generally inappropriate and their use can lead to incorrect inferences. Tests based on a heteroscedasticity consistent covariance matrix (HCCM), however, are consistent even in the presence of heteroscedasticity of an unknown form. Most applications that use a HCCM appear to rely on the asymptotic version known as HC0. Our Monte Carlo simulations show that HC0 often results in incorrect inferences when N {$\leq$} 250, while three relatively unknown, small sample versions of the HCCM, and especially a version known as HC3, work well even for N's as small as 25. We recommend that: (1) data analysts should correct for heteroscedasticity using a HCCM whenever there is reason to suspect heteroscedasticity; (2) the decision to use HCCM-based tests should not be determined by a screening test for heteroscedasticity; and (3) when N {$\leq$} 250, the HCCM known as HC3 should be used. Since HC3 is simple to compute, we encourage authors of statistical software to add this estimator to their programs.},

We provide a framework for formally ``declaring'' the analytically relevant features of a research design in a demonstrably complete manner, with applications to qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods research. The approach to design declaration we describe requires defining a model of the world (M), an inquiry (I), a data strategy (D), and an answer strategy (A). Declaration of these features in code provides sufficient information for researchers and readers to use Monte Carlo techniques to diagnose properties such as power, bias, accuracy of qualitative causal inferences, and other ``diagnosands.'' Ex ante declarations can be used to improve designs and facilitate preregistration, analysis, and reconciliation of intended and actual analyses. Ex post declarations are useful for describing, sharing, reanalyzing, and critiquing existing designs. We provide open-source software, DeclareDesign, to implement the proposed approach.},

  abstract = {SummaryGood statistical practice dictates that summaries in Monte Carlo studies should always be accompanied by standard errors. Those standard errors are easy to provide for summaries that are sample means over the replications of the Monte Carlo output: for example, bias estimates, power estimates for tests and mean squared error estimates. But often more complex summaries are of interest: medians (often displayed in boxplots), sample variances, ratios of sample variances and non-normality measures such as skewness and kurtosis. In principle, standard errors for most of these latter summaries may be derived from the Delta Method, but that extra step is often a barrier for standard errors to be provided. Here, we highlight the simplicity of using the jackknife and bootstrap to compute these standard errors, even when the summaries are somewhat complicated. {\copyright} 2014 The Authors.

  abstract = {In health research, statistical methods are frequently used to address a wide variety of research questions. For almost every analytical challenge, different methods are available. But how do we choose between different methods and how do we judge whether the chosen method is appropriate for our specific study? Like in any science, in statistics, experiments can be run to find out which methods should be used under which circumstances. The main objective of this paper is to demonstrate that simulation studies, that is, experiments investigating synthetic data with known properties, are an invaluable tool for addressing these questions. We aim to provide a first introduction to simulation studies for data analysts or, more generally, for researchers involved at different levels in the analyses of health data, who (1) may rely on simulation studies published in statistical literature to choose their statistical methods and who, thus, need to understand the criteria of assessing the validity and relevance of simulation results and their interpretation; and/or (2) need to understand the basic principles of designing statistical simulations in order to efficiently collaborate with more experienced colleagues or start learning to conduct their own simulations. We illustrate the implementation of a simulation study and the interpretation of its results through a simple example inspired by recent literature, which is completely reproducible using the R-script available from online supplemental file 1.},

It is becoming increasingly popular in all subfields of psychology and beyond. Adherence to the preregistration plan may not always be feasible and even is not necessarily desirable, but without disclosure of deviations, readers who do not carefully consult the preregistration plan might get the incorrect impression that the study was exactly conducted and reported as planned. In this paper, we have investigated adherence and disclosure of deviations for all articles published with the Preregistered badge in Psychological Science between February 2015 and November 2017 and shared our findings with the corresponding authors for feedback. Two out of 27 preregistered studies contained no deviations from the preregistration plan. In one study, all deviations were disclosed. Nine studies disclosed none of the deviations. We mainly observed (un)disclosed deviations from the plan regarding the reported sample size, exclusion criteria and statistical analysis. This closer look at preregistrations of the first generation reveals possible hurdles for reporting preregistered studies and provides input for future reporting guidelines. We discuss the results and possible explanations, and provide recommendations for preregistered research.},

Scientists are granted considerable latitude to selectively use and report the hypotheses, variables and analyses that create the most positive, coherent and attractive story while suppressing those that are negative or inconvenient. This creates a risk of bias that can lead to scientists fooling themselves and fooling others. Preregistration involves declaring a research plan (for example, hypotheses, design and statistical analyses) in a public registry before the research outcomes are known. Preregistration (1) reduces the risk of bias by encouraging outcome-independent decision-making and (2) increases transparency, enabling others to assess the risk of bias and calibrate their confidence in research outcomes. In this Perspective, we briefly review the historical evolution of preregistration in medicine, psychology and other domains, clarify its pragmatic functions, discuss relevant meta-research, and provide recommendations for scientists and journal editors.},

  abstract = {Background/aims:               Generalized estimating equations are a common modeling approach used in cluster randomized trials to account for within-cluster correlation. It is well known that the sandwich variance estimator is biased when the number of clusters is small ({$\leq$}40), resulting in an inflated type I error rate. Various bias correction methods have been proposed in the statistical literature, but how adequately they are utilized in current practice for cluster randomized trials is not clear. The aim of this study is to evaluate the use of generalized estimating equation bias correction methods in recently published cluster randomized trials and demonstrate the necessity of such methods when the number of clusters is small.                                         Methods:               Review of cluster randomized trials published between August 2013 and July 2014 and using generalized estimating equations for their primary analyses. Two independent reviewers collected data from each study using a standardized, pre-piloted data extraction template. A two-arm cluster randomized trial was simulated under various scenarios to show the potential effect of a small number of clusters on type I error rate when estimating the treatment effect. The nominal level was set at 0.05 for the simulation study.                                         Results:               Of the 51 included trials, 28 (54.9\%) analyzed 40 or fewer clusters with a minimum of four total clusters. Of these 28 trials, only one trial used a bias correction method for generalized estimating equations. The simulation study showed that with four clusters, the type I error rate ranged between 0.43 and 0.47. Even though type I error rate moved closer to the nominal level as the number of clusters increases, it still ranged between 0.06 and 0.07 with 40 clusters.                                         Conclusions:               Our results showed that statistical issues arising from small number of clusters in generalized estimating equations is currently inadequately handled in cluster randomized trials. Potential for type I error inflation could be very high when the sandwich estimator is used without bias correction.},

  abstract = {For randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with a single intervention being measured on multiple outcomes, researchers often apply a multiple testing procedure (such as Bonferroni or Benjamini-Hochberg) to adjust \$p\$-values. Such an adjustment reduces the likelihood of spurious findings, but also changes the statistical power, sometimes substantially, which reduces the probability of detecting effects when they do exist. However, this consideration is frequently ignored in typical power analyses, as existing tools do not easily accommodate the use of multiple testing procedures. We introduce the PUMP R package as a tool for analysts to estimate statistical power, minimum detectable effect size, and sample size requirements for multi-level RCTs with multiple outcomes. Multiple outcomes are accounted for in two ways. First, power estimates from PUMP properly account for the adjustment in \$p\$-values from applying a multiple testing procedure. Second, as researchers change their focus from one outcome to multiple outcomes, different definitions of statistical power emerge. PUMP allows researchers to consider a variety of definitions of power, as some may be more appropriate for the goals of their study. The package estimates power for frequentist multi-level mixed effects models, and supports a variety of commonly-used RCT designs and models and multiple testing procedures. In addition to the main functionality of estimating power, minimum detectable effect size, and sample size requirements, the package allows the user to easily explore sensitivity of these quantities to changes in underlying assumptions.},

  abstract = {This introduction to Monte Carlo methods seeks to identify and study the unifying elements that underlie their effective application. Initial chapters provide a short treatment of the probability and statistics needed as background, enabling those without experience in Monte Carlo techniques to apply these ideas to their research. The book focuses on two basic themes: The first is the importance of random walks as they occur both in natural stochastic systems and in their relationship to integral and differential equations. The second theme is that of variance reduction in general and importance sampling in particular as a technique for efficient use of the methods. Random walks are introduced with an elementary example in which the modeling of radiation transport arises directly from a schematic probabilistic description of the interaction of radiation with matter. Building on this example, the relationship between random walks and integral equations is outlined. The applicability of these ideas to other problems is shown by a clear and elementary introduction to the solution of the Schrodinger equation by random walks. The text includes sample problems that readers can solve by themselves to illustrate the content of each chapter.  This is the second, completely revised and extended edition of the successful monograph, which brings the treatment up to date and incorporates the many advances in Monte Carlo techniques and their applications, while retaining the original elementary but general approach.},

  abstract = {Randomized experiments are considered the gold standard for causal inference because they can provide unbiased estimates of treatment effects for the experimental participants. However, researchers and policymakers are often interested in using a specific experiment to inform decisions about other target populations. In education research, increasing attention is being paid to the potential lack of generalizability of randomized experiments because the experimental participants may be unrepresentative of the target population of interest. This article examines whether generalization may be assisted by statistical methods that adjust for observed differences between the experimental participants and members of a target population. The methods examined include approaches that reweight the experimental data so that participants more closely resemble the target population and methods that utilize models of the outcome. Two simulation studies and one empirical analysis investigate and compare the methods' performance. One simulation uses purely simulated data while the other utilizes data from an evaluation of a school-based dropout prevention program. Our simulations suggest that machine learning methods outperform regression-based methods when the required structural (ignorability) assumptions are satisfied. When these assumptions are violated, all of the methods examined perform poorly. Our empirical analysis uses data from a multisite experiment to assess how well results from a given site predict impacts in other sites. Using a variety of extrapolation methods, predicted effects for each site are compared to actual benchmarks. Flexible modeling approaches perform best, although linear regression is not far behind. Taken together, these results suggest that flexible modeling techniques can aid generalization while underscoring the fact that even state-of-the-art statistical techniques still rely on strong assumptions.},

Whereas recent computing and methodological advances have permitted increased efficiency in the simulation process, known as variance reduction, such experiments remain limited by their finite nature and hence are subject to uncertainty; when a simulation is run more than once, different results are obtained. However, virtually no emphasis has been placed on reporting the uncertainty, referred to here as Monte Carlo error, associated with simulation results in the published literature, or on justifying the number of replications used. These deserve broader consideration. Here we present a series of simple and practical methods for estimating Monte Carlo error as well as determining the number of replications required to achieve a desired level of accuracy. The issues and methods are demonstrated with two simple examples, one evaluating operating characteristics of the maximum likelihood estimator for the parameters in logistic regression and the other in the context of using the bootstrap to obtain 95\% confidence intervals. The results suggest that in many settings, Monte Carlo error may be more substantial than traditionally thought.},

This may cause the estimated effect of the intervention to be biased and also affect efficiency, coverage of confidence intervals, and statistical power. In cluster randomized trials non-compliance may occur at the subject level but also at the cluster level. In the latter case, all subjects within the same cluster have the same compliance status. The purpose of this study is to investigate the statistical implications of non-compliance in cluster randomized trials. A simulation study was conducted with varying degrees of non-compliance at either the cluster level or subject level. The probability of non-compliance depends on a covariate at the cluster or subject level. Various realistic values of the intraclass correlation coefficient and cluster size are used. The data are analyzed by intention to treat, as treated, per protocol and the instrumental variable approach. The results show non-compliance may result in downward biased estimates of the intervention effect and an under- or overestimate of its standard deviation. The coverage of the confidence intervals may be too small, and in most cases, empirical power is too small. The results are more severe when the probability of non-compliance increases and the covariate that affects compliance is unobserved. It is advocated to avoid non-compliance. If this is not possible, compliance status and covariates that affect compliance should be measured and included in the statistical model.},

However, the quality of simulation studies can vary widely in terms of their design, execution, and reporting.

We find that many articles do not provide complete and transparent information about key aspects of the study, such as justifications for the number of simulation repetitions, Monte Carlo uncertainty estimates, or code and data to reproduce the simulation studies. To address this problem, we provide a summary of the ADEMP (Aims, Data-generating mechanism, Estimands and other targets, Methods, Performance measures) design and reporting framework from Morris, White, and Crowther (2019) adapted to simulation studies in psychology. Based on this framework, we provide ADEMP-PreReg, a step-by-step template for researchers to use when designing, potentially preregistering, and reporting their simulation studies. We give formulae for estimating common performance measures, their Monte Carlo standard errors, and for calculating the number of simulation repetitions to achieve a desired Monte Carlo standard error. Finally, we give a detailed tutorial on how to apply the ADEMP framework in practice using an example simulation study on the evaluation of methods for the analysis of pre--post measurement experiments.},

  abstract = {The design and analysis of Monte Carlo experiments, with special reference to structural equation modelling, is discussed in this article. These topics merit consideration, since the validity of the conclusions drawn from a Monte Carlo study clearly hinges on these features. It is argued that comprehensive Monte Carlo experiments can be implemented on a PC if the experiments are adequately designed. This is especially important when investigating modern computer intensive methodologies like resampling and Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. We are faced with three fundamental challenges in Monte Carlo experimentation. The first problem is statistical precision, which concerns the reliability of the obtained results. External validity, on the other hand, depends on the number of experimental conditions, and is crucial for the prospects of generalising the results beyond the specific experiment. Finally, we face the constraint on available computer resources. The conventional wisdom in designing and analysing Monte Carlo experiments embodies no explicit specification of meta-model for analysing the output of the experiment, the use of case studies or full factorial designs as experimental plans, no use of variance reduction techniques, a large number of replications, and "eyeballing" of the results. A critical examination of the conventional wisdom is presented in this article. We suggest that the following alternative procedures should be considered. First of all, we argue that it is profitable to specify explicit meta-models, relating the chosen performance statistics and experimental conditions. Regarding the experimental plan, we recommend the use of incomplete designs, which will often result in considerable savings. We also consider the use of common random numbers in the simulation phase, since this may enhance the precision in estimating meta-models. The use of fewer replications per trial, enabling us to investigate an increased number of experimental conditions, should also be considered in order to improve the external validity at the cost of the conventionally excessive precision.},

Simulation studies should be designed to include some settings in which answers are already known. They should be coded in stages, with data-generating mechanisms checked before simulated data are analysed. Results should be explored carefully, with scatterplots of standard error estimates against point estimates surprisingly powerful tools. Failed estimation and outlying estimates should be identified and dealt with by changing data-generating mechanisms or coding realistic hybrid analysis procedures.
