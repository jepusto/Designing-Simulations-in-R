[["index.html", "Designing Monte Carlo Simulations in R Welcome License", " Designing Monte Carlo Simulations in R James E. Pustejovsky and Luke W. Miratrix 2022-05-12 Welcome Monte Carlo simulations are a computational technique for investigating the performance of a statistical model or method under known data-generating processes. By controlling the data generating process (e.g., by specifying true values for the parameters of a statistical model) and then repeatedly applying a statistical method to data generated by that process, it becomes possible to assess how well a statistical method works. Monte Carlo simulations are an essential tool of inquiry for quantitative methodologists and students of statistics, useful both for small-scale or informal investigations and for formal methodological research. In this monograph, we aim to provide an introduction to the logic and mechanics of designing simulation studies, using the R programming language. Our focus is on simulation studies for formal research purposes, as might appear in a methodological journal article, and for informing the design of empirical studies (e.g., power analysis).
