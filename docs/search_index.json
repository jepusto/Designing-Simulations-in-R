Thus, the data-analysis procedure or procedures are the central object of study. Depending on the research question, the data-analysis procedure might be very simple—as simple as just computing a sample correlation–or it might involve a combination of several components. For example, the procedure might entail first computing a diagnostic test for heteroskedasticity and then, depending on the outcome of the test, applying either a conventional formula or a heteroskedasticity-robust formula for standard errors. As another example, a data-analysis procedure might involve using multiple imputation for missingness on key variables, then fitting a statistical model, and then generating predicted values based on the model. Also depending on the research question, we might need to create several functions that implement different estimation procedures to be compared. In this chapter, we demonstrate how to implement data-analysis procedures in the form of R functions, so that their performance can be evaluated by repeatedly applying them to artificial data. We start by describing the high-level design of estimation functions and examining some simple but illustrative examples. We then discuss approaches for writing simulations that involve multiple estimation procedure. Next, we describe strategies for validating estimation functions. Finally, we examine methods for handling common computational problems with estimation procedures, such as non-convergence of maximum likelihood estimators. 7.1 Writing estimation functions In the abstract, a function that implements an estimation procedure should have the following form: estimate &lt;- function(data) { # calculations/model-fitting/estimation procedures return(estimates) } The function takes a dataset as input, fits a model or otherwise calculates an estimate, possibly with associated standard errors and so forth, and returns these quantities as output. The estimates could be point estimates of parameters, standard errors, confidence intervals, p-values, predictions, or other quantities. The calculations in the body of the function should be set up to use datasets that have the same structure (i.e., same dimensions, same variable names) as the output of the corresponding function for generating simulated data. However, in principle, we should also be able to run the estimation function on real data as well. In Chapter 5 we wrote a function called ANOVA_Welch_F() for computing \\(p\\)-values from two different procedures for testing equality of means in a heteroskedastic ANOVA: ANOVA_Welch_F &lt;- function(data) { anova_F &lt;- oneway.test(x ~ group, data = data, var.equal = TRUE) Welch_F &lt;- oneway.test(x ~ group, data = data, var.equal = FALSE) result &lt;- tibble( ANOVA = anova_F$p.value, Welch = Welch_F$p.value ) return(result) } Apply this function to a simulated dataset returns two p-values, one for the usual ANOVA \\(F\\) test (which assumes homoskedasticity) and one for Welch’s heteroskedastic \\(F\\) test: sim_data &lt;- generate_ANOVA_data( mu = c(1, 2, 5, 6), sigma_sq = c(3, 2, 5, 1), sample_size = c(3, 6, 2, 4) ) ANOVA_Welch_F(sim_data) ## # A tibble: 1 × 2 ## ANOVA Welch ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 0.0344 0.124 Our ANOVA_Welch_F() function is designed to work with the output of generate_ANOVA_data() in that it assumes that the grouping variable is called group and the outcome is called x. Relying on this assumption would be a poor choice if we were designing a function as part of an R package or for general-purpose use. However, because the primary use of the function is for simulation, it is reasonable to assume that the input data will always have appropriate variable names. In Chapter 6, we looked at a data-generating function for a bivariate Poisson distribution, an example of a non-normal bivariate distribution. We might use such a distribution to understand the behavior of Pearson’s sample correlation coefficient and its normalizing transformation, known as Fisher’s \\(z\\)-transformation, which is equivalent to the hyperbolic arc-tangent function (atanh() in R). When the sample measurements follow a bivariate normal distribution, Fisher’s \\(z\\)-transformed correlation is very close to normally distributed and its standard error is simply \\(1 / \\sqrt{N - 3}\\), and thus independent of the correlation. This makes \\(z\\)-transformation very useful for computing confidence intervals, which can then be back-transformed to the Pearson-\\(r\\) scale. In this problem, a simple estimation function would take a dataset with two variables as input and compute the sample correlation and its \\(z\\)-transformation, compute confidence intervals for \\(z\\), and then back-transform the confidence interval end-points. Here is an implementation of these calculations: r_and_z &lt;- function(data) { r &lt;- cor(data$C1, data$C2) z &lt;- atanh(r) se_z &lt;- 1 / sqrt(nrow(data) - 3) ci_z &lt;- z + c(-1, 1) * qnorm(.975) * se_z ci_r &lt;- tanh(ci_z) tibble( r = r, z = z, CI_lo = ci_r[1], CI_hi = ci_r[2] ) } To check that the function returns a result of the expected form, we generate a small dataset using the r_bivariate_Poisson() function developed in the last chapter, then apply our estimation function to the result: Pois_dat &lt;- r_bivariate_Poisson(40, rho = 0.5, mu1 = 4, mu2 = 4) r_and_z(Pois_dat) ## # A tibble: 1 × 4 ## r z CI_lo CI_hi ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 0.419 0.447 0.124 0.646 Although it is a little cumbersome to do so, we could also apply the estimation function to a real dataset. Here is an example, which calculates the correlation between ratings of judicial integrity and familiarity with the law from the USJudgeRatings dataset (which is included in base R). For the function to work on this dataset, we first need to rename the relevant variables. data(USJudgeRatings) USJudgeRatings %&gt;% dplyr::select(C1 = INTG, C2 = FAMI) %&gt;% r_and_z() ## # A tibble: 1 × 4 ## r z CI_lo CI_hi ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 0.869 1.33 0.769 0.927 The resulting r is the same as what we get by computing the correlation directly from the original dataset: cor.test(~ INTG + FAMI, data = USJudgeRatings) ## ## Pearson&#39;s product-moment correlation ## ## data: INTG and FAMI ## t = 11.238, df = 41, p-value = 4.283e-14 ## alternative hypothesis: true correlation is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## 0.7692563 0.9272343 ## sample estimates: ## cor ## 0.868858 It is a good practice to test out a newly-developed estimation function on real data as a check that it is working as intended. This type of test ensures that the estimation function is not using information outside of the dataset, such as by using known parameter values to construct an estimate. Applying the function to a real dataset demonstrates that the function implements a procedure that could actually be applied in real data analysis contexts. 7.2 Including Multiple estimation procedures Many simulations involve head-to-head comparisons between more than one data-analysis procedure. As a design principle, we generally recommend writing different functions for each estimation method one is planning on evaluating. Doing so makes it easier to add in additional methods as desired or to focus on just a subset of methods. Writing separate function also leads to a code base that is flexible and useful for other purposes (such as analyzing real data). Finally (repeating one of our favorite mantras), separating functions makes debugging easier because it lets you focus attention on one thing at a time, without worrying about how errors in one area might propagate to others. To see how this works in practice, we will return to the case study from Section 6.6, where we developed a data-generating function for simulating a cluster-randomized trial with student-level outcomes but school-level treatment assignment. Our data-generating process allowed for varying school sizes and heterogeneous treatment effects, which might be correlated with school size. Several different procedures might be used to estimate an overall average effect from a clustered experiment, including: Estimating a multi-level regression model (also known as a hierarchical linear model), Estimating an ordinary least squares (OLS) regression model and applying cluster-robust standard errors, or Averaging the outcomes by school, then estimating a linear regression model on the mean outcomes. All three of these methods are are widely used and have some theoretical guarantees supporting their use. Education researchers tend to be more comfortable using multi-level regression models, whereas economists tend to use OLS with clustered standard errors. Let’s develop estimation functions for each of these procedures. For now we won’t worry about incorporating the school size covariate, but will instead focus only on getting a point estimate, standard error, and \\(p\\)-value for the average treatment effect. For starters, we generate a sample dataset using a revised version of gen_cluster_RCT(), which corrects the bug discussed in Exercise 6.8.8: dat &lt;- gen_cluster_RCT( J=16, n_bar = 30, alpha = 0.8, p = 0.5, gamma_0 = 0, gamma_1 = 0.2, gamma_2 = 0.2, sigma2_u = 0.4, sigma2_e = 0.6 ) For the multi-level modeling strategy, there are several different existing packages that we could use. We will implement an estimator using the popular lme4 package, along with the lmerTest function for computing a \\(p\\)-value for the average effect. Here is a basic implementation: analysis_MLM &lt;- function( dat ) { M1 &lt;- lme4::lmer( Yobs ~ 1 + Z + (1 | sid), data = dat ) M1_test &lt;- lmerTest::as_lmerModLmerTest(M1) M1_summary &lt;- summary(M1_test)$coefficients tibble( ATE_hat = M1_summary[&quot;Z&quot;,&quot;Estimate&quot;], SE_hat = M1_summary[&quot;Z&quot;,&quot;Std. Error&quot;], p_value = M1_summary[&quot;Z&quot;, &quot;Pr(&gt;|t|)&quot;] ) } The function fits a multi-level model with a fixed coefficient for the treatment indicator and random intercepts for each school. To get a p-value for the treatment coefficient, we have to convert the model into an lmerModLmerTest object and then pass it through summary(). The function outputs only the statistics in which we are interested. Our function makes use of the lme4 and lmerTest packages. Rather than assuming that these packages will be loaded, we call relevant functions using the package name as a prefix, as in lme4::lmer(). This way, we can run the function even if we have not loaded the packages in the global environment. This approach is also preferable to loading packages inside the function itself (e.g., with require(lme4)) because calling the function does not change which packages are loaded in the global environment. Here is a function implementing OLS regression with cluster-robust standard errors: analysis_OLS &lt;- function( dat, se_type = &quot;CR2&quot; ) { M2 &lt;- estimatr::lm_robust( Yobs ~ 1 + Z, data = dat, clusters = sid, se_type = se_type ) tibble( ATE_hat = M2$coefficients[[&quot;Z&quot;]], SE_hat = M2$std.error[[&quot;Z&quot;]], p_value = M2$p.value[[&quot;Z&quot;]] ) } To get cluster-robust standard errors, we use the lm_robust() function from the estimatr() package, again calling only the relevant function using the package prefix rather than loading the whole package. A novel aspect of this estimation function is that it includes an additional intput argument, se_type, which allows us to control the type of standard error calculated by lm_robust(). Adding this option would let us use the same function to compute (and compare) different types of clustered standard errors for the average treatment effect estimate. We set a default option of \"CR2\", just like the default of lm_robust(). Finally, here is a function implementing the aggregate-then-analyze approach: analysis_agg &lt;- function( dat, se_type = &quot;HC2&quot; ) { datagg &lt;- dplyr::summarise( dat, Ybar = mean( Yobs ), n = n(), .by = c(sid, Z) ) stopifnot( nrow( datagg ) == length(unique(dat$sid) ) ) M3 &lt;- estimatr::lm_robust( Ybar ~ 1 + Z, data = datagg, se_type = se_type ) tibble( ATE_hat = M3$coefficients[[&quot;Z&quot;]], SE_hat = M3$std.error[[&quot;Z&quot;]], p_value = M3$p.value[[&quot;Z&quot;]] ) } Note the stopifnot command. Putting assert statements in your code like this is a good way to guarantee you are not introducing weird and hard-to-track errors in your code. For example, R likes to recycle vectors to make them the right length; if you gave it a wrong length in error, this can be a brutal error to discover. The stopifnot statements halt your code as soon as something goes wrong, rather than letting that initial wrongness flow on to further work, showing up in odd results that you don’t understand later on. See Section 17.2 for more. All of our functions produce output in the same format: analysis_MLM( dat ) ## Warning in check_dep_version(): ABI version mismatch: ## lme4 was built with Matrix ABI version 2 ## Current Matrix ABI version is 1 ## Please re-install lme4 from source or restore original &#39;Matrix&#39; package ## # A tibble: 1 × 3 ## ATE_hat SE_hat p_value ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 -0.00876 0.396 0.983 analysis_OLS( dat ) ## # A tibble: 1 × 3 ## ATE_hat SE_hat p_value ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 0.0241 0.457 0.959 analysis_agg( dat ) ## # A tibble: 1 × 3 ## ATE_hat SE_hat p_value ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 -0.00937 0.394 0.981 Ensuring that the output of all the functions is structured in the same way will make it easy to keep the results organized once we start running multiple iterations of the simulation. If each estimation method returns a dataset with the same variables, we can simply stack the results on top of each other. Here is a function that bundles all the estimation procedures together: estimate_Tx_Fx &lt;- function( data, CR_se_type = &quot;CR2&quot;, agg_se_type = &quot;HC2&quot; ) { dplyr::bind_rows( MLM = analysis_MLM( dat ), OLS = analysis_OLS( dat, se_type = CR_se_type), agg = analysis_agg( dat, se_type = agg_se_type), .id = &quot;estimator&quot; ) } estimate_Tx_Fx(dat) ## # A tibble: 3 × 4 ## estimator ATE_hat SE_hat p_value ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 MLM -0.00876 0.396 0.983 ## 2 OLS 0.0241 0.457 0.959 ## 3 agg -0.00937 0.394 0.981 This is a common coding pattern for in simulations that involve multiple estimation procedures. Each procedure is expressed in its own function, then these are assembled together in a single function so that they can all easily be applied to the same dataset. Stacking the results row-wise will make it easy to compute performance measures on the results. This will become more evident once we are working across multiple replications of the simulation process, as we will in Chapter 8. 7.3 Validating Estimation Procedures Just as with data-generating functions, it is critical to verify the accuracy of the estimation functions. If an estimation function involves a known procedure that has been implemented in R or one of its contributed packages, then a straightforward way to do this is to compare your implementation to another existing implementation. For estimation functions that involve multi-step procedures or novel methods, other approaches to verification may be needed, which rely more on available statistical theory. 7.3.1 Checking against existing implementations For our Welch test function, we can check the output of ANOVA_Welch_F() against the built-in oneway.test function. Let’s do that with a fresh set of data: sim_data &lt;- generate_ANOVA_data( mu = c(1, 2, 5, 6), sigma_sq = c(3, 2, 5, 1), sample_size = c(3, 6, 2, 4) ) aov_results &lt;- oneway.test(x ~ factor(group), data = sim_data, var.equal = FALSE) aov_results ## ## One-way analysis of means (not assuming equal variances) ## ## data: x and factor(group) ## F = 6.2706, num df = 3.0000, denom df = 3.9952, p-value = 0.05426 Welch_results &lt;- ANOVA_Welch_F(sim_data) all.equal(aov_results$p.value, Welch_results$Welch) ## [1] TRUE We use all.equal() because it will check equality up to a tolerance in R, which can avoid some perplexing errors due to rounding. For the bivariate correlation example, we can check the output of r_and_z() against R’s built-in cor.test() function, as we have already demonstrated in Section 7.1. Such a test is even more useful here because r_and_z() uses our own implementation of the confidence interval calculations, rather than relying on R’s built-in functions as we did with ANOVA_Welch_F(). 7.3.2 Checking novel procedures Simulations are usually an integral part of projects to develop novel statistical methods. Such projects present a puzzle: if an estimation procedure truly is new, how do you check that your code is correct? Effective methods for doing so will vary from problem to problem, but an over-arching strategy is to use theoretical results about the performance of the estimator to check that your implementation works as expected. For instance, we might work out the algebraic properties of an estimator for a special case and then check that the result of the estimation function agrees with our algebra. For some estimation problems, we might be able to identify theoretical properties of an estimator when applied to a very large sample of data and when the model is correctly specified. If we can find results about large-sample behavior, then we can test an estimation function by applying it to a very large sample and checking whether the resulting estimates and very close to specified parameter values. We illustrate each of these approaches using our functions for estimating treatment effects from cluster-randomized trials. First, we test an algebraic property. With each of the three methods, the treatment effect estimator is a difference between the weighted average of the outcomes from students in each treatment condition; the only difference between the estimators is in what weights are used. In the special case where all schools have the same number of students, the weights used by all three methods end up being the same: all three methods allocate equal weight to each school. Therefore, we know that there should be no difference between the three point estimates. Furthermore, a bit of algebra will show that the cluster-robust standard error from the OLS approach will end up being identical to the robust standard error from the aggregation approach. If there are equal numbers of schools assigned to both conditions, then the standard error from the multilevel model will also be identical to the other standard errors. Let’s verify that our estimation functions produce results that are consistent with these theoretical properties. To do so, we will need to generate a dataset with equal cluster sizes, setting \\(\\alpha = 0\\): dat &lt;- gen_cluster_RCT( J=12, n_bar = 30, alpha = 0, p = 0.5, gamma_0 = 0, gamma_1 = 0.2, gamma_2 = 0.2, sigma2_u = 0.4, sigma2_e = 0.6 ) table(dat$sid) # verify equal-sized clusters ## ## 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 ## 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 estimate_Tx_Fx(dat) ## # A tibble: 3 × 4 ## estimator ATE_hat SE_hat p_value ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 MLM 0.371 0.398 0.374 ## 2 OLS 0.371 0.398 0.374 ## 3 agg 0.371 0.398 0.374 All three methods yield identical results. Now let’s try equal school sizes but unequal allocation to treatment: dat &lt;- gen_cluster_RCT( J=12, n_bar = 30, alpha = 0, p = 2 / 3, gamma_0 = 0, gamma_1 = 0.2, gamma_2 = 0.2, sigma2_u = 0.4, sigma2_e = 0.6 ) estimate_Tx_Fx(dat) ## # A tibble: 3 × 4 ## estimator ATE_hat SE_hat p_value ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 MLM -0.109 0.348 0.760 ## 2 OLS -0.109 0.328 0.750 ## 3 agg -0.109 0.328 0.745 As expected, all three point estimators match, but the SE from the multilevel model is a little bit discrepant from the others. It is often the case that as you design your simulation, and then start analyzing the results, you will find your estimators are really not working as planned. Such surprises will usually be due to (at least) three factors: you did not implement your method correctly, your method is not yet a good idea in the first place, or you do not yet understand something important about how your method works. When faced with poor performance you thus will debug your code, revise your method, and do some serious thinking. Ideally this will eventually lead you to a deeper understanding of a method that is a better idea in general, and correctly implemented in all likelihood. For example, in one research project Luke and other co-authors were working on a way to improve Instrumental Variable (IV) estimation using post-stratification. The idea is to group units based on a covariate that predicts compliance status, and then estimate within each group; hopefully this would improve overall estimation. In the first simulation, the estimates were full of NAs and odd results because we failed to properly account for what happens when the number of compliers was estimated to be zero. That was table stakes: after repairing that, we still found odd behavior and serious and unexpected bias, which turned out to be due to failing to implement the averaging of the groups step correctly. We fixed the estimator again and re-ran, and found that even when we had a variable that was almost perfectly predictive of compliance, gains were still surprisingly minimal. Eventually we understood that the groups with very few compliers were actually so unstable that they ruined the overall estimate. These results inspired us to introduce other estimators that dropped or down-weighted such strata, which gave our paper a deeper purpose and contribution. Simulation is an iterative process. It is to help you, the researcher, learn about your estimators so you can find a way forward with your work. What you learn then feeds back to the prior research, and you have a cycle that you eventually step off of, if you want to finish your paper. But do not expect it to be a single, well-defined, trajectory. 7.4 Handling errors, warnings, and other hiccups 7.5 Exercises 7.5.1 More Heteroskedastic ANOVA In the classic simulation by Brown and Forsythe (1974), they not only looked at the performance of the homoskedastic ANOVA-F test and Welch’s heteroskedastic-F test, they also proposed their own new hypothesis testing procedure. Write a function that implements the Brown-Forsythe F* test (the BFF* test!) as described on p. 130 of Brown and Forsythe (1974), using the following code skeleton: BF_F &lt;- function( data ) { # fill in the guts here return(pval) } Run the following code to check that your function produces a result: sim_data &lt;- generate_ANOVA_data( mu = c(1, 2, 5, 6), sigma_sq = c(3, 2, 5, 1), sample_size = c(3, 6, 2, 4) ) BF_F( sim_data ) Try calling your BF_F function on a variety of datasets of different sizes and shapes, to make sure it works. What kinds of datasets should you test out? Add the BFF* test into the output of Welch_ANOVA_F() by calling your BF_F() function inside the body of Welch_ANOVA_F(). The onewaytests package implements a variety of different hypothesis testing procedures for one-way ANOVA. Validate your Welch_ANOVA_F() function by comparing the results to the output of the relevant functions from onewaytests. 7.5.2 Contingent testing In the one-way ANOVA problem, one approach that an analyst might think to take is to conduct a preliminary significance test for heterogeneity of variances (such as Levene’s test or Bartlett’s test), and then report the \\(p\\)-value from the homoskedastic ANOVA F test if variance heterogeneity is not detected but the \\(p\\)-value from the BFF* test if variance heteogeneity is detected. Modify the Welch_ANOVA_F() function to return the \\(p\\)-value from this contingent BFF* test in addition to the \\(p\\)-values from the (non-contingent) ANOVA-F, Welch, and BFF* tests. Include an input option that allows the user to control the \\(\\alpha\\) level of the preliminary test for heterogeneity of variances, as in the following skeleton. Welch_ANOVA_F &lt;- function( data , pre_alpha = .05) { # preliminary test for variance heterogeneity # compute non-contingent F tests for group differences # compute contingent test # compile results return(result) } 7.5.3 Check the cluster-RCT functions Section 7.2 presented functions implementing several different strategies for estimating an average treatment effect from a cluster-randomized trial. Write some code to validate these functions by comparing their output to the results of other tools for doing the same calculation. Use one or more datasets simulated with gen_cluster_RCT(). For each of these tests, you will need to figure out the appropriate syntax by reading the package documentation. For analysis_MLM(), check the output by fitting the same model using lme() from the nlme() package or glmmTMB() from the package of the same name. For analysis_OLS(), check the output by fitting the linear model using the base R function lm(), then computing standard errors using vcovCL() from the sandwich package. Also compare the output to the results of feeding the fitted model through coef_test() from the clubSandwich package. For analysis_agg(), check the output by aggregating the data to the school-level, fitting the linear model using lm(), and computing standard errors using vcovHC() from the sandwich package. 7.5.4 Extending the cluster-RCT functions Exercise 6.8.10 from Chapter 6 asked you to extend the data-generating function for the cluster-randomized trial to include generating a student-level covariate, \\(X\\), that is predictive of the outcome. Use your modified function to generate a dataset. Modify the estimation functions from Section 7.2 to use models that include the covariate as a predictor. Further extend the functions to include an input argument for the set of predictors to be included in the model, as in the following skeleton for the multi-level model estimator: analysis_MLM &lt;- function(dat, predictors = &quot;Z&quot;) { } analysis_MLM( dat ) analysis_MLM( dat, predictors = c(&quot;Z&quot;,&quot;X&quot;)) analysis_MLM( dat, predictors = c(&quot;Z&quot;,&quot;X&quot;, &quot;X:Z&quot;)) Hint: Check out the reformulate() function, which makes it easy to build formulas for different sets of predictors.
