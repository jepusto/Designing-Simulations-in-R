# Introduction

## Purpose of simulations

Computer simulations are an essential tool of inquiry for statisticians and quantitative methodologists, useful both for small-scale or informal investigations and for formal methodological research. Simulation studies involve investigating the performance of a statistical model or method under known data-generating processes. By controlling the data generating process (e.g., by specifying true values for the parameters of a statistical model) and then repeatedly applying a statistical method to data generated by that process, it becomes possible to assess the accuracy of a statistical procedure, as well as other aspects of a procedure's performance. 

Simulations are used to address a range of questions: 

* Many statistical estimation procedures can be shown (through mathematical analysis) to work well _asymptotically_---that is, given an infinite amount of data---but their performance in small samples is more difficult to quantify. Simulation is a tractable approach for assessing the small-sample performance of such methods, or for determining minimum required sample sizes for adequate performance of a method. For example, heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors (HRSE) are known to work asymptotically, but can be misleading in small samples. Long and Ervin (2000) investigate the performance of HRSE for a range of sample sizes, demonstrating that the most commonly used form of these estimators often does NOT work well with sample sizes typical in the social sciences.
* In practice, statistical methods are often used in combination. For instance, in a regression model, one could first use a statistical test for heteroskedasticity (e.g., the White test or the Breusch-Pagan test) and then determine whether to use conventional standard errors or HRSE depending on the result of the test. This combination of an initial diagnostic test followed by contingent use of different statistical procedures is all but impossible to analyze mathematically, but it is straight-forward to simulate (again, see Long & Ervin, 2000). 
* Many statistical estimation procedures can be shown (through mathematical analysis) to perform well when the assumptions they entail are correct. However, it practice it is often of interest to also understand their robustness---that is, their performance when one or more of the assumptions is incorrect.
* There may be several potential methods available for conducting a certain analysis. Simulation is a useful way to determine whether some methods are superior to others. For instance, Brown and Forsythe (1974) compared four different procedures for conducting a hypothesis test for equality of means in several populations (i.e., one-way ANOVA), but where the population variances are not equal.

The purpose of this monograph is to provide a guide to designing simulation studies to answer questions about statistical methodology. The focus is on studies used for formal research purposes (i.e., as might appear in a journal article or dissertation), although many of the programming techniques are relevant to less formal situations as well.
