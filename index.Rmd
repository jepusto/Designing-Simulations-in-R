# Welcome {-}

Monte Carlo simulations are a computational technique for investigating the performance of a statistical model or method under known data-generating processes.
By controlling the data generating process (e.g., by specifying true values for the parameters of a statistical model) and then repeatedly applying a statistical method to data generated by that process, it becomes possible to assess how well a statistical method works. Monte Carlo simulations are an essential tool of inquiry for quantitative methodologists and students of statistics, useful both for small-scale or informal investigations and for formal methodological research.
In this monograph, we aim to provide an introduction to the logic and mechanics of designing simulation studies, using the R programming language. Our focus is on simulation studies for formal research purposes, as might appear in a methodological journal article, and for informing the design of empirical studies (e.g., power analysis).

# About the authors {-}


James E. Pustejovsky is an associate professor at the University of Wisconsin - Madison, where he teaches in the Quantitative Methods Program within the Department of Educational Psychology. He completed a Ph.D. in Statistics at Northwestern University.

*Luke Miratrix*: I am currently an associate professor at Harvard University's Graduate School of Education. I completed a Ph.D. in Statistics at UC Berkeley after having traveled through three different graduate programs (computer science at MIT, education at UC Berkeley, and then finally statistics at UC Berkeley). Simulation has become a way for me to think, over the years. This might be because I am fundamentally lazy, and the idea of sitting down and trying to do a bunch of math to figure something out seems less fun than writing up some code "real quick" so I can see how things operate. Of course, "real quick" rarely is that quick â€“ and before I know it I got sucked into trying to learn some esoteric aspect of how to best program something, and then a few rabbit holes later I may have discovered something interesting!  I find simulation quite absorbing, and I also find them reassuring (usually with regards to whether I have correctly implemented some statistical method). This book has been a real pleasure to write, because it's given me actual license to sit down and think about why I do the various things I do, and also which way I actually prefer to approach a problem. And getting to write this book with my co-author has been a particular pleasure, for talking about the business of writing simulations is rarely done in practice. This has been a real gift, and I have learned so much.
