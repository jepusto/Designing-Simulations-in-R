# Welcome {-}

Monte Carlo simulations are a computational technique for investigating the performance of a statistical model or method under known data-generating processes.
By controlling the data generating process (e.g., by specifying true values for the parameters of a statistical model) and then repeatedly applying a statistical method to data generated by that process, it becomes possible to assess how well a statistical method works. Monte Carlo simulations are an essential tool of inquiry for quantitative methodologists and students of statistics, useful both for small-scale or informal investigations and for formal methodological research.
In this monograph, we aim to provide an introduction to the logic and mechanics of designing simulation studies, using the R programming language. Our focus is on simulation studies for formal research purposes, as might appear in a methodological journal article, and for informing the design of empirical studies (e.g., power analysis).

The material in this book was initially developed through courses that we offered at the University of Texas at Austin (James) and Harvard University (Luke) and then from a series of workshops that we offered through the Society for Research on Educational Effectiveness in June of 2021. We are grateful for feedback, questions, and corrections we have received from many students who participated in these courses.
