# Simulations as evidence

We began this book with an acknowledgement that simulation is fraught with the potential for misuse: _simulations are doomed to succeed_.
We close by reiterating this point, and also disussing several ways researchers might argue for their simulations being more useful than typical.

In particular a researcher might do any of the following 

 1.   Use extensive multi-factor simulations
 2.   Beat them at their own game. Generate simulations based on prior literature.
 3.   Build calibrated simulations
 
## Use extensive multi-factor simulations

"If a single simulation is not convincing, use more of them," is one principle a reseacher might take.
By conducting extensive multifactor simulations, once can explore a large space of possible data generating scenarios.
If, across the full range of scenarios, a general story bears out, then perhaps that will be more convincing than a narrower range.

Of course, the critic will claim that some aspect that is not varying is the real culprit.
If this is unrealistic, then the findings, across the board, may be less relevant.
Thus, pick the factors one varies with care.

## Beat them at their own game

If a prior paper uses a simulation to make a case, one approach is to replicate that simulation, adding in the new estimator one wants to evaluate.
This makes it (more) clear that you are not fishing: you are using something established in the literature as a published benchmark.
By constraining oneself to published simulations, one has less wiggle room to cherry pick a data generating process that works the way you want.

## Calibrated simulations

A practice in increasing vogue is to generate _calibrated simulations_.
These are simulations tailored to a specific applied contexts, with the results of the simulation studies designed to more narrowly inform what assumptions and structures are necessary in order to make progress in that context.

Often these simulations are built out of existing data.
For example, one might sample, with replacement, from the covariate distribution of an actual dataset so that the distribution of covariates is authentic in how the covariates are distributed and, more importantly, how they co-relate.

The problem with this approach is one still needs to generate a ground truth to assess how well the estimators work in practice.
It is very easy to accidently put a very simple model in place for this component, thus making a calibrated simulation quite naive in the very way that counts.
