### MCSE for power and coverage

For power and coverage, we score, for each simulation, a 0 if we do not reject (or capture the parameter) and a 1 otherwise.
We are counting successes, and take the proportion of successes as our overall estimate of performance.
Because the replications are independent, these rates follow a binomial distribution with MCSE 

$$MCSE = \sqrt{\frac{\rho_\alpha\left(1 - \rho_\alpha\right)}{R}} .$$
